# UX Design
## Introduction
UX might not mean much to you, and yet it's an essential practice to make a website attractive to our friends, the users. Bridging marketing, users, and design, UX is primarily the combination of 2 values:
::: tip Experience
Practice of something or someone, testing of something, from which knowledge, understanding, and habit are derived. There is knowledge to be gained from this practice.
:::
AND
::: tip User
Person who uses an object or tool.

## But wait, what's the difference between UI and UX design?
You may have seen or heard about it, but in design, there are 2 distinct concepts to consider. UX design focuses on simplifying interactions for users, while UI design focuses on **the visual appearance and presentation of the user interface**.

## What is the ultimate goal of UX?
UX design aims to create user experiences that are both pleasant and intuitive. Focusing on simplicity and clarity, UX design seeks to make interactions with digital products fluid and natural with the goal of ***making users recognize the value of the product.***
There is another fundamental objective of UX design which is to meet the needs and expectations of end users.
To achieve this, UX designers must deeply understand users' behaviors, motivations, and frustrations.

::: warning In short
> The goal of user experience design is to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty through utility, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction with a product.

## Process
### A- User Research
The objective of this first part is to understand users' needs, behaviors, and expectations. This analysis is determined using several methods:
- ***Interviews***: You will need to interview people to understand their needs and frustrations
- ***Surveys***: Provide an online questionnaire with multiple choices to collect quantitative data
- ***User Testing***: Based on the data collected through your questionnaires, you will build prototypes and have them tested by your users to identify areas for improvement
- ***Data Analysis***: You will use the data to understand how users interact with the product and refine the product's user experience

### B- Creation of Personas and Use Scenarios
*Wait! What's a persona?*<br>
::: tip Definition
A persona is an archetype representing a group of people whose behaviors, motivations, and goals are similar.
They are used in Design, Ergonomics, Marketing, Computing... to help designers determine what the product or service should do and how it should work.

### B1. What do we build a persona from?

Thanks to our friend Alan Cooper, we prop.... Huh? Who's Alan Cooper? An actor from Jurassic Park? No! He's a pioneer developer in thinking about software design that takes into account the end user.
Now that we know who he is, let's see what he has to propose regarding persona design.
To build a persona, our Alan suggests 5 types of variables:

::: info Variables
- ***Activities***: What the user does, how frequently, and in what volume
- ***Attitudes***: What the user thinks about the product domain
- ***Aptitudes***: What training the user has and their learning capacity
- ***Motivation***: Why the user is engaged in the product domain
- ***Skills***: The user's capabilities relative to the domain and technologies
:::

### B1. B- What are personas used for?
::: info Variables
- ***Synthesize ideas***: that emerge from observations and user interviews
- ***Communicate and share a common vision***: of users within the team
- ***Generate affect and empathy***: for users who might be difficult to access
- ***Aid in decision-making***: in product design
