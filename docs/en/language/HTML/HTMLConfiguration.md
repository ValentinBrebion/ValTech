# HTML Configuration
## HTML History
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a "markup" language created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.

::: info Version History
### HTML 1.0
>Appearing in the early 1990s, the first version of HTML emerged as simple, allowing page creation through a very basic page structure.

### HTML 2.0
>The new version was validated in September 1995 by the W3C. The emergence of new browsers led to the appearance of new tags such as headers, different heading levels, title lines, and also the addition of images (initially `xbn` and `gif` formats). The introduction of tables, graphics, and forms allowed users to interact with websites.

**⚠️ Due to the language's popularity, many browsers wanted to improve HTML by following their own code, but this ended up creating browser harmonization problems. ⚠️**

### HTML 3.0
> This new version was introduced to provide webmasters with better means to create web pages. However, it didn't achieve the expected success because browsers weren't fast enough to implement the new features that HTML 3.0 integrated.

ℹ To address the implementation problem, it was decided that future improvements would be made gradually to give different web browsers time to update ℹ️

### HTML 3.2
> The most famous version of HTML standardized at the end of 1996 by the W3C. Also called `Wilbur`, it introduced new font and image features.

### HTML 4.0
> Also called `COUGAR`, it became a W3C standard in 1998. It brought improvements to previous properties such as scripts, frames, etc. It enhanced tables by adding complexity and made forms more efficient.

## Prerequisites
No specific knowledge is needed to create HTML pages, apart from curiosity. However, you need at minimum an environment and resources to guide you in creating HTML pages.

### <u>Step 1: The Browser</u>
::: info Choose a browser

or use your usual browser

### <u>Step 2: IDE (Integrated Development Environment)</u>
This is the working tool for developers. It will give you access to all the functionalities of all programming languages: all in one 😉

::: warning Advice
To start in development, I advise you to get used to simple IDEs like:
- Windows: <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/" target="_blank"><Badge type="tip" text="NotePad" /></a>
- macOS: `TextEdit` (pre-installed)
:::

Then, once you've mastered an IDE, you can download one of the following IDEs according to your preferences:
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank"><Badge type="tip" text="Visual Studio Code (VS Code)" /></a>
- <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/download" target="_blank"><Badge type="tip" text="Sublime Text" /></a>
- <a href="https://brackets.io/" target="_blank"><Badge type="tip" text="Brackets" /></a>

or others...
