# Git Language

*Git is a free and open-source software, created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the author of the Linux kernel. In other words, it's a decentralized version control system. Its incredible branch system for development has won over the developer community, seeing it as a new way to save and share their code.*

## <u>Decentralized?</u>

::: tip Info
**Yes indeed! Git uses a reference server to improve its service. Let's take an example with a developer: they're working on their project and do a git push. And boom, a power outage! No worries because the reference server will send the changes once the server becomes operational again - handy, right?**

## <u>Git Installation Procedure</u>

First, go to [Git's official page](https://git-scm.com/). For Windows users, you can click directly on ``download for Windows``. Once the executable is downloaded, run it. After that, you'll have to choose between two versions.

## <u>Standalone Installer and Portable ("thumbdrive edition")</u>

::: details Standalone Installer
Standalone Installer is a program that requires installation on a computer to be used. Basically, a git .exe will be installed on your computer and you'll be able to use the ``"git bash here"`` button which will allow you to initialize the folder or, if it's already the case, use commands to send modified files to the remote repository.

::: details Standalone Portable
A portable standalone application is designed to be used without installation on a computer. It comes in the form of a folder containing the application and all its dependencies and a configuration file. You can therefore run it directly from the folder on a computer.

Once the executable is installed (for the standalone installer version), you should see the option: ``Git Bash Here`` when right-clicking on a folder.
