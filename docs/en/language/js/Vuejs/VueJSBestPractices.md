# Best Practices in VueJs üëç

<br/>

*As a junior VueJs developer, I need to adopt from the start all the best practices to implement when developing a user interface. Indeed, I believe that implementing these best practices from the beginning greatly limits errors, time waste, and poor ways of proceeding. The different rules that I will list in these pages come from the official VueJs website:* <a href="https://vuejs.org/style-guide/" target="_blank"><Badge type="warning" text="documentation" /></a>

*It's also obvious that I won't include all the rules mentioned on the site but only those that seem **important** to me.*
