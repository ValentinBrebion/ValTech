## The Consequences Following These Cyber Attacks
We don't really realize the global impact that a cyber attack can have on a company as a whole. Unfortunately, they are very real. Let's take an example: the company has just been the victim of a cyber attack. What could be the consequences beyond the loss of data and equipment?

::: code-group

```Financial
Loss of money due to production stoppages, lost work hours,
ransom payments, loss of customers, loss of market share
leading to decreased turnover, cost of system restoration
and protection, communication costs to regain customer trust.
```

```Eco/social
Job losses, business closures or bankruptcies lead
to increased unemployment.
```
```Psychological
Employees would be confused, worried, angry, could fall
into depression and lose self-confidence.
```
