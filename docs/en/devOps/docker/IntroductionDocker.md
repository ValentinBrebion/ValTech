# Introduction to Docker
Docker is an open-source platform launched in 2013 by DotCloud (which later became Docker Inc.). Its creator, Solomon Hykes, developed Docker to simplify application deployment using containers, a technology that isolates applications and their dependencies in a portable and lightweight environment.

## The Principle of Containerization
You've probably heard about it, but the term containerization can be unclear for beginners. Let's define this term together:
:::tip Definition
A container is like a lightweight and portable box. Inside this box, you put ***everything your application needs to run***: the code, libraries, configurations, and even the operating system.

## The Benefits?
- Common environment between development and deployment
- Encourages best practices
- Improves application security and control

# CI/CD Testing and Continuous Integration

## Continuous Integration
Continuous integration aims to quickly detect integration problems by automating the code building and testing process. It improves code and allows for quick and regular code validation.

## Continuous Deployment
Continuous deployment is the automation of the deployment process, ensuring rapid deliverables and improving quality by detecting small errors more frequently.

## Monitoring
Using tools, you can monitor your application, which means:
- Server metrics tracking
- Application performance monitoring
- Log tracking

## The Benefits?
- Quick failure detection
- Performance monitoring
- Security improvement
